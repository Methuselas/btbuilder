<p>Some implementation of the Bard's Tale Construction Set functionality in
Bt Builder is not exactly the same as the original.  Most changes have been
made to conform with the earlier Bard's Tale games.<p>

<p><h2>Character Creation</h2></p>

<p>The BTCS does not list the starting hit point range for characters.
Currently Bt Builder uses 15 to 28 plus 1 for each point of constitution
above 14.  If someone knows the correct range or creates a BTCS character
that is not in this range, please send me an
<a href="mailto:dulsi@identicalsoftware.com">email</a>.</p>

<p>After select a race in BTCS, ability scores are determined and shown
until a key is pressed.  It then lists the available classes with the
abilities possibly scrolling offscreen.  The previous Bard's Tale games
would list the ability scores and available classes on a single screen.
Bt Builder uses the older display.</p>

<p><h2>Adventurer's Guild</h2></p>

<p>When listing characters to add a member to the party or delete, BTCS
displays a list of nine characters and "(More)" if there are more
characters.  The older games displayed scrolling a list of characters
allowing the player to scroll up and down.  Bt Builder has decided to
conform to the older games.  Unfortunately BTCS also puts the saved
parties at the end of the roster which requires scrolling through the
entire list.  Bt Builder displays parties at the top of the roster.</p>

<p><h2>Garth's</h2></p>

<p>BTCS displays a list of items available with numbers one to nine.  After
you select an item by pressing it's number, it displays the price and allow
you to accept or decline.  The older Bard's Tale games displayed the list
of item with price.  Since they allowed more than nine items in the shop
they allow you to scroll up and down the list to select one.  Bt Builder
mimics the older Bard's Tale games.  At this time the shop is still limited
to the nine items but that will likely be removed later.  Similar change
has been made to the selling interface.</p>

<p><h2>Combat</h2></p>

<p>BTCS does not allow you to choose what monsters to attack with melee
attack.  Instead it is randomly determined based on what monsters are
within range.  Previous Bard's Tales allowed you to choose who to attack.
Our implementation is like the older games with the exception that it
will randomly find an opponent if the group you specified has been killed.</p>

<p><h2>Icons</h2></p>

<p>Icons have been added to main screen.  They are not currently animated.
The light spell spell creates a flame.  Trap destruction creates an eye.
The compass spell shows the direction your party is facing.</p>
