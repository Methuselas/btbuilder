<p><h2>About</h2></p>

<p>Bt Builder is an open source implementation of the Bard's Tale Construction
Set.  The eventual goal is to make a game builder that can implement the three
main Bard's Tale games in addition to Construction Set games.  Other possible
extensions include Wasteland and Dragon Wars.  The editor file formats and
custom pictures have been deciphered.  At current we do not intend to decipher
all file formats instead a new free collection of graphics and sounds will be
included with the game. Work has started on a primitive map editor. The game
interface fairly usable at the moment. The unimplemented features from the
construction set are listed in the README.</p>

<p><h2>Recent News</h2></p>

<p>Oct 14, 2013: Bt Builder 0.3.14 released. Fixed a bug with page down on lists
that are less than a full page. Bt Builder now tries to load .xml files in
preference to .MAP files. If a .xml and .MAP file have the same prefix, the map
editor will only display the .xml file. The map editor no longer saves a broken
.MAP file if it determines that the map has features that are not supported in
that format. A very primitive monster editor has been added. It doesn't allow
you to edit all the fields yet.</p>
