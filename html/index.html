<p><h2>About</h2></p>

<p>Bt Builder is an open source implementation of the Bard's Tale Construction
Set.  The eventual goal is to make a game builder that can implement the three
main Bard's Tale games in addition to Construction Set games.  Other possible
extensions include Wasteland and Dragon Wars.  The editor file formats and
custom pictures have been deciphered.  At current we do not intend to decipher
all file formats instead a new free collection of graphics and sounds will be
included with the game. Work has started on a primitive editor. The game
interface is fairly usable at the moment. The unimplemented features from the
construction set are listed in the README.</p>

<p>Feb 14, 2013: Bt Builder 0.4.1 released. Fixed a bug where a rogue would
stay hidden if they were hidden at the end of a combat. Implemented altering
the speed of text in combat with the '+' and '-' keys. Identify is now
available at the shop. Added some validity checks to loading the walls.xml so
that the user is alerted to problems with the file.</p>
