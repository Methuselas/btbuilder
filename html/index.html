<p><h2>About</h2></p>

<p>Bt Builder is an open source implementation of the Bard's Tale Construction
Set.  The eventual goal is to make a game builder that can implement the three
main Bard's Tale games in addition to Construction Set games.  Other possible
extensions include Wasteland and Dragon Wars.  The editor file formats and
custom pictures have been deciphered.  At current we do not intend to decipher
all file formats instead a new free collection of graphics and sounds will be
included with the game. The game interface is fairly usable at the moment. The
eidtor is usable but not very user friendly. Some elements are not editable
from the UI yet.</p>

<p><h2>Recent News</h2></p>

<p>December 24, 2015: Bt Builder 0.5.6 released. Golem and dwarf/normad image
animated. Added special command to select a PC. Added special conditionals to
see if a PC is selected, if selected PC passes a skill check and if everyone
passes a skill check. Added unlimited use option to regen skill effect. Added
delay option to regen mana. Fix the check class special. Added continuous
effect items. To use them set the # of uses to 256. You probably want to make
the source of the spell to be item instead of magic so that antimagic fields
don't end the effect. Fixed bug that allowed dead monsters to attack. Modified
Builder City 2 game to have mage staff and bardsword. Removed btbuilder only
map from Builder City game so that it can run in BTCS.</p>
