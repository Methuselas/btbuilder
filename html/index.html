<p><h2>About</h2></p>

<p>Bt Builder is an open source implementation of the Bard's Tale Construction
Set.  The eventual goal is to make a game builder that can implement the three
main Bard's Tale games in addition to Construction Set games.  Other possible
extensions include Wasteland and Dragon Wars. It is still very early in
development.  The editor file formats and custom pictures have been
deciphered.  At current we do not intend to decipher all file formats instead
a new free collection of graphics and sounds will be included with the game.
No editor has been developed.  The game interface is incomplete but
started.</p>

[The Windows build is currently hacked together mingw32.  Instead of using
SDL_image library, the needed code was added to the executable.]</p>

<p><h2>Recent News</h2></p>

<p>Sep 11, 2009: Bt Builder 0.2.11 released.  Phase door and detect secret door
spells implemented.  Darkness special implemented.  Support for multiple
versions of walls/doors.  That allows every x wall/door to be a slight
variation so that the players can tell that he is moving.  No graphics making
use of that yet.</p>
