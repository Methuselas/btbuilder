<p><h2>About</h2></p>

<p>Bt Builder is an open source implementation of the Bard's Tale Construction
Set.  The eventual goal is to make a game builder that can implement the three
main Bard's Tale games in addition to Construction Set games.  Other possible
extensions include Wasteland and Dragon Wars. It is still very early in
development.  The editor file formats and custom pictures have been
deciphered.  At current we do not intend to decipher all file formats instead
a new free collection of graphics and sounds will be included with the game.
No editor has been developed.  The game interface is incomplete but
started.</p>
