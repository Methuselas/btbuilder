<p><h2>About</h2></p>

<p>Bt Builder is an open source implementation of the Bard's Tale Construction
Set.  The eventual goal is to make a game builder that can implement the three
main Bard's Tale games in addition to Construction Set games.  Other possible
extensions include Wasteland and Dragon Wars.  The editor file formats and
custom pictures have been deciphered.  At current we do not intend to decipher
all file formats instead a new free collection of graphics and sounds will be
included with the game. Work has started on a primitive editor. The game
interface is fairly usable at the moment.</p>

<p><h2>Recent News</h2></p>

<p>Sep 29, 2014: Bt Builder 0.4.8 released. Armor and hit bonus spells support
not stacking bonuses. Fixed crash when pressing 1 on inventory screen without
any items. Fixed crash when you delete a person from the roster who is in your
party and then remove them from your party. Fixed crash when you save a party
with an existing name and have to pick a new name. Save spell effects properly
so that characters restored from a save file have the right stats. (Previous
save files will not be corrected.) Add monsters to the roster when removed from
the party.</p>
