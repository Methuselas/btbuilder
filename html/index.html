<p><h2>About</h2></p>

<p>Bt Builder is an open source implementation of the Bard's Tale Construction
Set.  The eventual goal is to make a game builder that can implement the three
main Bard's Tale games in addition to Construction Set games.  Other possible
extensions include Wasteland and Dragon Wars.  The editor file formats and
custom pictures have been deciphered.  At current we do not intend to decipher
all file formats instead a new free collection of graphics and sounds will be
included with the game. Work has started on a primitive editor. The game
interface is fairly usable at the moment. The unimplemented features from the
construction set are listed in the README.</p>

<p>Mar 24, 2014: Bt Builder 0.4.3 released. All functionality found in Bard's
Tale Construction Set now available. Most images have been removed from the
release due a license conflict. Some images from opengameart.org have been
added. Editing a picture for a monster or a draw picture special command now
displays the image. The old images are available for download if you wish to
continue using them.</p>
