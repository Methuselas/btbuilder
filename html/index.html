<p><h2>About</h2></p>

<p>Bt Builder is an open source implementation of the Bard's Tale Construction
Set.  The eventual goal is to make a game builder that can implement the three
main Bard's Tale games in addition to Construction Set games.  Other possible
extensions include Wasteland and Dragon Wars.  The editor file formats and
custom pictures have been deciphered.  At current we do not intend to decipher
all file formats instead a new free collection of graphics and sounds will be
included with the game. Work has started on a primitive map editor. The game
interface fairly usable at the moment. The unimplemented features from the
construction set are listed in the README.</p>
