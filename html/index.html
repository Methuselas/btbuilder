<p><h2>About</h2></p>

<p>Bt Builder is an open source implementation of the Bard's Tale Construction
Set.  The eventual goal is to make a game builder that can implement the three
main Bard's Tale games in addition to Construction Set games.  Other possible
extensions include Wasteland and Dragon Wars.  The editor file formats and
custom pictures have been deciphered.  At current we do not intend to decipher
all file formats instead a new free collection of graphics and sounds will be
included with the game. Work has started on a primitive editor. The game
interface is fairly usable at the moment. The unimplemented features from the
construction set are listed in the README.</p>

<p><h2>Recent News</h2></p>

<p>May 9, 2014: Bt Builder 0.4.5 released. Added copy functionality to
monsters, items and spells. Some more images were added. Monsters and spells
are sorted when selecting one to edit. Unfortunately when you need to select
one for some other reason like summon monster, sorting is not applied yet.
Trade gold implemented. Monster names displayed when casting a spell on them.
You can now save a game. You will be asked to if you want to restore when you
load the module. Currently "clear special" and "set special" effects are not
saved. Music is not restored but the effect of the bard song is.
