<p>The editor for Bt Builder is very primative. To start the editor you simply press 'e' instead of pressing enter to play a module. From here you see the map selection screen. There is no editor for the items, monsters, or spells at this time.<p>

<p>The map editor works similar to the BTCS. Unlike the BTCS the arrow keys move you in the specified direction. To change facing press End or PgDn for left right respectively. In addition to 's', 'c', and 'l' from BTCS, it support 'r' to resize the map. If the map is too large to fit on one screen, the map will scroll when you move past the view section.</p>

<p>If you press 's', it brings up a list of specials. You can then place a special by finding the one you want and pressing enter. If instead you press 'e', you will open the special editor.<p>

<p>The special editor is fairly different from the BTCS version. It starts with name like BTCS. The next item is Flags. Right now you can't edit the Flags. Next comes the list of commands but in a different format. You will see "&lt;New Operation&gt;". Under if statements you also have the option to add new operations. Pressing insert will insert a new statement above the current statement. The delete key will remove the current line.</p>

<p>Editing a command does not prepopulate with the previous information. If you edit a print statement, you will need to select the print command again and reenter the entire text. There are no suggestions or error checking on values. To some degree this is due to Bt Builder having less restrictions but it does allow you to enter bad data.</p>
