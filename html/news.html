<p><h2>News</h2></p>

<p>Oct 22, 2013: Bt Builder 0.3.16 released. Fix a bug that causes Bt Builder
to crash when editing some monsters or creating new ones. Add the rest of
the fields to the spell editor.</p>

<p>Oct 21, 2013: Bt Builder 0.3.15 released. A primitive item and spell editor
has been added. The item editor allows you to edit everything but isn't very
user friendly. The spell editor is more of a work in progress.</p>

<p>Oct 14, 2013: Bt Builder 0.3.14 released. Fixed a bug with page down on lists
that are less than a full page. Bt Builder now tries to load .xml files in
preference to .MAP files. If a .xml and .MAP file have the same prefix, the map
editor will only display the .xml file. The map editor no longer saves a broken
.MAP file if it determines that the map has features that are not supported in
that format. A very primitive monster editor has been added. It doesn't allow
you to edit all the fields yet.</p>

<p>Oct 7, 2013: Bt Builder 0.3.13 released. You can now add new specials to
a map. Baylor's Spell Bind is available for Bt Builder specific modules. It
only works on a single creature at the moment. The effect only works when
specified as a single target. Eventually it will be enhanced to work on a
group. It only has an effect at Start. Run and End effects are nothing.</p>

<p>Apr 15, 2013: Bt Builder 0.3.12 released. A primative special editor is
implemented. See the <a href="edit.html">editor page</a> for more information.
Bt Builder now include a spec file for easily building an rpm for Fedora. Page
up and down implemented on select lists.</p>

<p>Oct 29, 2012: Bt Builder 0.3.11 released. Restore picture and label after
a combat during a special. Fix map resizing to not leave one way walls.
Explain how to use map editor in readme. Animated spell icons. Fixed some
spell damage text to not end with "and". Allow a monster to not be found in
random encounters. Fixed missing files from map editor list. Removed some non
map files for map editor list. Implemented play sound special. Fixed animation
timing. Darkness zone stops new lights but allows a flash of light unlike BTCS
implementation. Added light level in map files. Support for multiple groups of
monsters in random encounters. Higher resolution graphics for lots of things
added.</p>

<p>Oct 14, 2012: Bt Builder 0.3.10 released. Use 'e' on a module to load
primitive map editor.</p>

<p>Oct 13, 2012: Bt Builder 0.3.9 released. Added some 640x400 images. Added
new wilderness graphics. Added a primitive map editor. The map editor only
edits the walls and allows placement of specials. Creating specials can't be
done at the moment. It allows resizing a map but walls at the edges are not
corrected so they may be only one way. It can save the BTCS map file format
if no Bt Builder only features are used.</p>

<p>Oct 7, 2012: Bt Builder 0.3.8 released. Fixed the sample game to allow you
to talk to the queen after defeating Dral. Added the ability to switch to
full screen by pressing F12. Modified image loading code to support higher
resolution but fallback to lower quality image if the higher resolution
image is not available.</p>

<p>Oct 5, 2012: Bt Builder 0.3.7 released. Hunter's critical hits and thief's
sneak attack now only work with melee weapons. Dispell illusion and dispell
magic implemented. This required heavy changes to spell expiration. Animated
spell icons are in the build but they do not animate in the game yet. Lots
of new wall tiles are available. Modified the sample games a bit.</p>

<p>Sep 28, 2012: Bt Builder 0.3.6 released. Hide in shadows now critically
hits. It also informs you that you succeeded or failed. Monsters and
characters have gender. Character creation allows you to specify the
character's gender. Added music for the safety song. Made a second demo game.
The second demo is currently the same as the first except it allows 12 items
per character, uses xml files for many files and has proper plural names for
monsters.</p>

<p>Sep 25, 2012: Bt Builder 0.3.5 released. Hide in shadows is partially
working. It doesn't critically hit yet. The xml monster files now support a
plural name instead of just adding "(s)". Various bug fixes and compile fix
for new libpng. New slot images. Support for a larger number of item slots.</p>

<p>Sep 18, 2012: Bt Builder 0.3.4 released. Rate of attacks not increased
properly. Buying spell levels doesn't always work properly. XP needed didn't
display when you don't have enough XP to advance. Increase monk's bare hands
damage as they advance in level.</p>

<p>Sep 17, 2012: Bt Builder 0.3.3 released. Shops can now have different
inventory than the first nine items. Items sold to the shop are available
for purchase. Silence zones do not allow new songs. Support for walls that
are immune to phase door. Fixed quitting under windows. Clicking on the close
button will also work now although it doesn't warn you about losing your
progress like it does when you use 'q' to quit. Lots of new graphics.</p>

<p>Aug 25, 2012: Bt Builder 0.3.2 released. Implemented the rest of the
special attacks for monsters. Implemented item-zot. Fixed a bug in writing xml
files under windows. Fixed a bug that didn't cause all the bitfield
information to be written to the xml file. Fully implemented anti-magic zones.
Made it possible to have walls unaffected by phase door and removed the
hard-coded handling of secret doors in the binaries.</p>

left. Do not consume items when charges used up except for arrows and thrown
