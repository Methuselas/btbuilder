Bt Builder is the beginnings of an open source Bard's Tale Construction
Set.  It is extremely early in development.  To build it you will need
the source code, SDL, SDL_Image, boost, expat and PhysFS.  SDL_ttf is
optional and not built in the windows version.  It will only be usable
in Bt Builder modules instead of BTCS modules.  Run make to compile.
The programs found in the util directory need the Identical Software
Graphics Library to build.

The program can read the BTCS files.  The core game engine is still a
work in progress.  Most specials have been implemented but combat and
spells are still not complete.  It can also print information about
monsters, spells, items and maps.

Running Bt Builder will bring up the module selection screen.  A sample
game is included.

To directly run the sample game, run:

btbuilder sample

To print the spells in the game, run:

btbuilder -s sample

To print the monsters in the game, run:

btbuilder -m sample

To print the items in the game, run:

btbuilder -i sample

To print a map in the game, run:

btbuilder -pCITYBUIL.MAP sample

The program is made available under the GPL.
