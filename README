Bt Builder is the beginnings of an open source Bard's Tale Construction
Set.  It is extremely early in development.  To build it you will need
the source code, SDL, SDL_ttf, SDL_Image, expat and PhysFS.  Run make
to compile.  The programs found in the util directory need the Identical
Software Graphics Library to build.

The program can read the BTCS files.  The core game engine is still a
work in progress.  Some specials have been implemented but not enough
to run a complete game.  It can also print information about
monsters, spells, items and maps.

To run the sample game, run:

btbuilder sample

To print the spells in the game, run:

btbuilder -s sample

To print the monsters in the game, run:

btbuilder -m sample

To print the items in the game, run:

btbuilder -i sample

To print a map in the game, run:

btbuilder -pCITYBUIL.MAP sample

The program is made available under the GPL.
