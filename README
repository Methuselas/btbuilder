Bt Builder is the beginnings of an open source Bard's Tale Construction
Set.  It is extremely early in development.  To build it you will need
the source code, the Identical Software Graphics Library and SDL.
Modify the Makefile so that the paths to the graphics library is
correct and type make.

Currently the program can only read the BTCS files and print out some
information on monsters, spells and items.

The program is made available under the GPL.
